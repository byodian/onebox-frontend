# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## React rich text editor component - Customizing the Builds

### Creating custom builds with [online builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/)

1. Choosing the editor type
2. Choosing plugins
3. Toolbar composition
4. Choosing the default language
5. Download the customized build

### Integating a build from the online builder

1. Download the customized build
2. Setting up folders
```
├── ckeditor5
│   ├── build
│   ├── sample
│   ├── src
│   ├── ...
│   ├── package.json
│   └── webpack.config.js
├── node_modules
├── public
├── src
├── ...
└── package.json
```
3. Add the package located in the ckeditor5 directory as a dependency of your project
```bash
npm install ./ckeditor5
```

4. Import the build in your application
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Editor from 'ckeditor5-custom-build/build/ckeditor';
import { CKEditor } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react'

const editorConfiguration = {
    toolbar: [ 'bold', 'italic' ]
};

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
    <div className="App">
      <h2>Using CKEditor 5 from online builder in React</h2>
      <CKEditor
          editor={ Editor }
          config={ editorConfiguration }
          data="<p>Hello from CKEditor 5!</p>"
          onReady={ editor => {
              // You can store the "editor" and use when it is needed.
              console.log( 'Editor is ready to use!', editor );
          } }
          onChange={ ( event, editor ) => {
              const data = editor.getData();
              console.log( { event, editor, data } );
          } }
          onBlur={ ( event, editor ) => {
              console.log( 'Blur.', editor );
          } }
          onFocus={ ( event, editor ) => {
              console.log( 'Focus.', editor );
          } }
      />
    </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```
